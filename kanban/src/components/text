Intro: Isaiah is in a "coding bootcamp" and he has to complete an app for his final project. Think of this final project like a Capstone project. He thanks you for your time and open minds.

Summary:
 The app would double as an online planner and a place where you can check your grades(Infinite Campus). The problem with Infinite Campus is that parents are unable to see their child's grades if teachers forget to update grades. With this app, teachers will be able to assign homework, so that parents can see what their child needs to complete before the grades even come out. 

Features:
 1. Alarm / Notification to let the student know when assignments are due
 2. Students can see when assignments are Assigned, In Progress and Done
 3. Clean User Interface (unlike infinite campus)
